                    Early Navigational Techniques
                    In ancient times, mariners navigated by the guidance of the sun and stars and landmarks along the coast. The Phoenicians were among the most daring of the ancient navigators. They built large ships and, traveling out of sight of land by day and by night, probably circumnavigated Africa. The Vikings and Norsemen, who crossed the Atlantic to Iceland, Greenland, and Newfoundland, are reputed to have used a sunstone

                     to aid their voyages. The Pacific islanders navigated from island to island across the open ocean using observations of guide stars and the moon, the winds, waves, and currents, and birds, knowledge of which was passed from generation to generation; the Polynesians especially traversed enormous stretches of the Pacific.
